# 🛡️ Project Aegis  
### AI-Driven Autonomous Internal Developer Platform (IDP)

Project Aegis is a **self-healing, AI-powered Kubernetes platform** that combines GitOps, Observability, Progressive Delivery, Security Guardrails, and FinOps to automatically deploy, monitor, diagnose, and remediate application failures with minimal human intervention.

> Think of Aegis as a closed-loop system:  
> **Code → Deploy → Observe → Detect → Analyze → Fix → Redeploy**
